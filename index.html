    <p class="desc">
      This page will let you know what day it is and what "time" of day it is. This page uses the JavaScript date
      reference to
      display time and day. Created an if statement to loop through this criteria: Morning (5am to 12 noon), Afternoon
      (12 noon to 6pm), Evening (6pm to 11pm), Night (11pm to 5am). Images, phrases, and colors were also used to
      display the time. For example, "good morning!" has a background color of light yellow and a good morning image.
      Javascript date referenced was used to grab the time of day, day (Tuesday), and year:
      <pre><code>
        let myDate = new Date();
        let myHour = myDate.getHours();
        let day = myDate.getDay();
        let year = myDate.getFullYear()
      </code></pre>
    </p>
